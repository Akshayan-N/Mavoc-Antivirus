<details>
  <summary><b>Quick Scan <img width=18px src= "core/stopwatch.png" /></b></summary>
  <p><b>There are 2 types of Scans, Quick Recursive and Non-Recursive Scan.</b></p>
  <p>Quick Recursive Scan will scan all files recursively in the common paths, even inside temporary files and folders within the common directory path. </p>
  <p>Quick Non-Recursive scan will simply look for common places where malware, payloads, etc., may be stored.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Schedule Scan <img width=18px src= "core/schedule.png" /></b></summary>
  <p>To initiate a Schedule Scan with Mavoc Antivirus, you need to start the Mavoc Antivirus application mavoc.ps1 instead of starting the framework.py by.</p>
  <p>By Default the summary scan will download and install modules
  <p>Schedule Scan will scan and completely remove malicious files on a common path every 1 minute by default, but you can adjust the timing in the mavoc.ps1 script.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Full Scan <img width=18px src= "core/error.png" /></b></summary>
  <p><b>There are Two Types of Scans: Full Scan and Partition Scan.</b></p>

  <p>Network Protection contains a list of more than 42,000 malicious sites. When enabled, it blocks access to these sites. You can reset it to the default settings by choosing to disable the network blocker.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Cloud Firm Scan <img width=18px src="core/security.png" /></b></summary>

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Clean System <img width=18px src="core/system.png" /></b></summary>
  <p>Clean System is used to remove unwanted files from common directory paths, such as temporary and registry paths. It automatically deletes these files to optimize system performance and enhance security.</p>
